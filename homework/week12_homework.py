# Python Programming Week 12 Homework
# 1. Difference of Max and Min Numbers in List
# Create a function that takes a list and returns the difference between the smallest and biggest numbers.
# Examples

# difference_max_min([10, 4, 1, 4, -10, -50, 32, 21]) ➞ 82
# Smallest number is -50, biggest is 32.

# difference_max_min([44, 32, 86, 19]) ➞ 67
# Smallest number is 19, biggest is 86.


def difference_max_min(num_list):
    pass

# 2. Check if a List Contains a Given Number
# Write a function to check if a list contains a particular number.
# Examples

# check([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3) ➞ True
# check([1, 1, 2, 1, 1], 3) ➞ False
# check([5, 5, 5, 6], 5) ➞ True
# check([], 5) ➞ False

# Notes: Don't forget to return the result.


def check(num_list, target):
    pass
