# Python Programming Week 13 Homework
# 1. Convert Minutes into Seconds

# Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it to seconds.
# Examples
# convert(5) ➞ 300
# convert(3) ➞ 180
# convert(2) ➞ 120

# Notes: Don't forget to return the result. If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab. If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab.


def convert(minutes):
    pass


print(convert(5))
print(convert(3))
print(convert(2))


# 2. Maximum Edge of a Triangle

# Create a function that finds the maximum range of a triangle's third edge.
# Examples

# nextEdge(8, 10) ➞ 17
# nextEdge(5, 7) ➞ 11
# nextEdge(9, 2) ➞ 10
# Notes
#     (side1 + side2) - 1 = maximum range of third edge.
#     All given triangles have side lengths that are positive integers.
#     Don't foget to return the result.


def nextEdge(side1, side2):
    pass


print(nextEdge(8, 10))
print(nextEdge(5, 7))
print(nextEdge(9, 2))
